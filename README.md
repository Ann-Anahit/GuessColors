![Guess-Colors header](assets/images/header.png)

The Color Mixing Game is a simple guessing game where players are presented with two colors and are asked to guess the resulting color when those two colors are mixed together. It's a fun way to test one's understanding of color combinations and to learn about the outcomes of mixing different colors.

## Introduction


## Project 

The aim of this project is to:

- The primary goal is to provide players with an enjoyable gaming experience. The game offers a simple yet engaging activity that can be entertaining for people of various ages.
- Through gameplay, players can learn about color combinations and color mixing. It's a fun way to explore basic concepts of color theory and understand how different colors interact with each other.
- The game can help players improve their observational skills and ability to recognize color combinations. It also encourages critical thinking as players make educated guesses about the resulting color.

### User goals:

- The primary user goal for players is to correctly guess the resulting color when two random colors are mixed together.
- Players aim to achieve a high score by making accurate guesses within the given rounds.
- Ultimately, the goal is to have fun while engaging in a challenging and entertaining gameplay experience.


### Site owner goals

- From a developer's point of view, the user goal is to create an engaging and bug-free game that provides an enjoyable experience for players.
- Developers aim to implement features that make the game intuitive to play, such as clear instructions, easy-to-understand interface elements, and responsive feedback to user actions.
- They also strive to ensure that the game is free from technical issues and errors, providing a seamless experience for players.


### Pre development
I created a flow chart. All I had to do then is follow my flow chart and code one area at a time before moving on to the next. 

![Guess-Colors flow chart](assets/images/flowchart.jpg)

### Development

1 Creating the ASCII List: I started by defining an ASCII list containing color codes mapped to their respective names. This step likely involved researching ASCII color codes and compiling them into a dictionary for easy reference.

2 Designing the Header: Next, I designed the header for the game, which typically includes the game title, instructions, and any other relevant information to introduce players to the game.

3 Implementing Functions: After setting up the initial data structures, you proceeded to implement the necessary functions for the game logic. This includes functions for mixing colors, displaying instructions, presenting color options, getting user guesses, playing rounds, and managing the main game loop.


## Features

### Color Mixing
The core feature of the game is mixing two colors together to produce a resulting color. This feature involves randomly selecting two colors from a predefined list and determining the resulting color based on predefined combinations.

### Displaying Instructions

![](/assets/images/cc-rm-name.png)


Next. The contractor is asked to select their profession. An error message is displayed if an invalid letter is added:

![CCCCP profession](/assets/images/cc-rm-profession-invalid.png)

An opportunity to pick again if the wrong profession was selected has also been given.

![CCCCP profession](/assets/images/cc-rm-profession-incorrect.png)

### Hourly pay and employee number
Once a contractor has selected their name and profession and confirms the information is correct, the computer brings up confirmation of their hourly pay and contractor number.

![CCCCP pay](/assets/images/cc-rm-pay-number-confirmation.png)

### Working dates, days and hours
The contractor is then prompted to add the dates they worked, the number of days and the number of hours. The number of days worked was not originally included in the program but after testing it was added to avoid any confusion about the days a contractor has worked. 

![CCCCP dates](/assets/images/cc-rm-incorrect-dates.png)

The dates and number of days must match exactly otherwise the user cannot continue to add any further details. This avoids a contractor adding that they worked for 1-08-2023 to 7-08-2023 but they only worked 3 out of those 7 days. The contractor will then have to complete the exact number of days to continue moving forward.

### Confirm information so far

The contractor will be asked to confirm all the information they have submitted so far before being able to move on. 

![CCCCP check](/assets/images/cc-rm-check-information.png)

If anything needs to change e.g. name, professions, hours, dates etc. the contractor selects n for no.

![CCCCP no selection](/assets/images/cc-rm-check-information-invalid.png)

### Tax and National Insurance
Once all information has been added the program will give a contractor a rough estimate of the tax and national insurance due, which is taken by an umbrella company they joined. The majority of self-employed contractors pay 20% tax or less so it wasn't felt necessary to include a 40% tax option for those earning more than Â£67,500 in a tax year. This could be added in the future if necessary.

![CCCCP confirm](/assets/images/cc-rm-check-information-ok.png)

### Confirmation of information

Once the amount before and after tax has been shown the contractor can confirm that they would like this information submitted to HR. HR keep detailed information on the contractors they use and the hours they work. The information submitted is checked by a manager who confirms the working hours and days. Information on tax and NI payments is sent to the umbrella company.


### What the portal checks


A name is inputted and not left blank. Instructions are given to only use letters to avoid a delay in payment.

![CCCCP name](/assets/images/cc-rm-name-error.png)


Profession is chosen from a list of options

![CCCCP professions](/assets/images/cc-rm-profession.png)

The dates (must be within a two month period), the total number of days and hours worked.

![incorrect dates](/assets/images/cc-rm-incorrect-dates.png)


As per Working Time Regulations 1998 a maximum of 13 hours are allowed in a day. App checks that less than 13 hours is inputted per day.

![CCCCP hours](/assets/images/cc-rm-13.png)

Hours can not exceed the dates.


Based on information provided a calculation is made to determine pay before tax and then pay after tax and NI deductions.


![CCCCP confirm](/assets/images/cc-rm-check-information-ok.png)

The program checks that the contractor is ready to submit this information. 

If they select yes, they receive confirmation of submission

![CCCCP submission](/assets/images/cc-rm-information-submitted.png)

If they select no, they are invited to re-submit, as shown above.

### Error Page

A 404 error page has been included. The html was run through the W3C html validator and errors removed. A css style file was created to support the display of the text on the page.


## Google Sheets

Using Google sheets wasn't part of the original project spec and was added after all the code was created, tested and working. The sheet contains two sections

### Payments
In this area the following contractor information is included:

- First name
- Last name
- Profession
- Start date
- End date
- Pay before tax

![gsheet](assets/images/gsheet-rm-ccccp.png)

### Tax
In this area the following contractor information is included:

- First name
- Last name
- Profession
- Pay before tax
- Tax to pay
- National Insurance to pay

![gsheet](assets/images/gsheet2-rm-ccccp.png)

This information is sent to the umbrella company.

## Technologies Used

- miro.com to create flow chart

### Libraries
[colorama Fore & Back](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)
[random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) - to generate contractor number
[typing](https://www.101computing.net/python-typing-text-effect/))
[datetime](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime)

## Testing

The portal has been well tested and the results can be viewed [here - TESTING](https://github.com/todiane/corri-construction-p3/blob/main/TESTING.md)


## Future Updates

The next update of the app will include the option to choose whether it is their first visit (which will show the instructions) or whether they have used the service before - which will show the instructions behind a button.

The ability for a manager to log into the system and confirm working dates and days for each contractor all in one place rather than via separate emails.

Relevant information is accessible by the umbrella company so that HR doesn't have to collate and forward this information.

Other future updates are included in the TESTING.md file.

## Validation

PEP8 - Python style guide checker imported - https://pypi.org/project/pep8/
All code validated and where lines were showing as too long they were adjusted. Some line adjustments caused bugs in the code and it stopped working so they were left as longer lines to avoid this issue. pycodestyle . - was used in Codeanywhere terminal to list any issues.

## Deployment

## Bugs

After importing the type element so that text can be typed out a line at a time the codes for Fore.WHITE or bold kept showing up e.g. '\033[1m' for bold was typed out. To fix this I had to remove - colorama.init(autoreset=True) - which  meant I had to go through each line of code to ensure if one line was red, all subsequent lines didn't turn red.
